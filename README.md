# Questions for open panel

 - Can a single team submit an entry for Category 1 (Probability) *and* Category 1 (Non-Probability)?
 - "Solutions that solely rely upon law enforcement contact surveys will not be considered." Does this eliminate using law enforcement data (such as cell phone numbers via incident reports) as a potential source for a phone contact?

# Criteria for Judging Surveys

 - Representative– entries accurately represent the characteristics of the community on the key dimensions of race, ethnicity, age, and gender.
 - Cost effective – so that they can be deployed frequently to better understand patterns in changes in community perceptions.
 - Accurate across microgeographies – produce accurate estimates across microgeographies (i.e., the smallest unit that does not reveal the identities of any individuals) to reveal differences in patterns of perceptions.
 - Frequent – capable of low-burden administration on a systematic basis.
 - Scalable – able to be successfully deployed in jurisdictions of varying sizes.

# Potential Pilot

Compare simple survey to [Raleigh survey](https://data-ral.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/community-survey-fy18/explore) in 2018, which has markers for Census blocks. Do our own pilot of a few postal routes using direct mailing, get response rates plus compare to prior survey.

Left a message at https://raleighnc.gov/government/services/community-survey to see about the price for survey and if they will post the 2020 data.
